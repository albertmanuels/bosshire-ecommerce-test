/**
 * Mocked admin user account based on real data from FakeStoreAPI.
 *
 * This account is selected as the application's default admin because:
 * - It is one of the actual users from the FakeStoreAPI (`/users` endpoint).
 * - Both `username` and `password` meet the minimum login requirement (â‰¥ 8 characters).
 *
 * This user can be used for testing or role-based access control in scenarios
 * where admin-level permissions are needed.
 *
 * @example
 * if (user.username === ADMIN.username && user.password === ADMIN.password) {
 *   // grant admin access
 * }
